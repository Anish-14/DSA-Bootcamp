            // here you'll see if the char whose freq is max that is there to remove then we are not updating
            // the maxFreq, but it also works because the answer is gonna change only when we get a char with
            // maxFreq greater than the previous one, if we get the same maxFreq then we'll get the same answer
            // therefore it doesn't matter
